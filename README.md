# symphonyProject

Instructions to run locally:

`yarn install`
`yarn start`

There are two `environment` files, `environment.local.js` (which is ignored by git for the sake of development testing), and `environment.js`
 which could be used for production.
 
 There are bugs with some parts of UI, it's not responsive and there are some bugs with API endpoints for the moment.
